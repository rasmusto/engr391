\section{Ch. 8: RQ 2}
How does resource scheduling reduce flexibility in managing projects?

If you have to worry about when you are allowed to use a resource, you will be less productive.
Also, if you finish early, you will not be allowed access to a specific resource until the scheduled time.

\section{Ch. 8: RQ 6}
Why is it critical to develop a time-phased baseline?

Time-phased baselines make up for poor representation of project progress found in other models.
Other project progress testing will judge progress based solely on money spent, but this can be a poor indicator of the progress that has actuall been made.
