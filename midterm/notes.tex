    \section{Project Management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is a ``project''? - Project: A complex, non-routine, one-time effort limited by time, budget, resources, and performance specifications designed to meet customer needs.
        \item Projects cost money and bring benefit
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Comparison of Routine Work with Projects}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Routine, Repetitive Work
        \item Programs versus Projects
        \item Program:  A series of coordinated, related, multiple projects that continue over an extended time and are intended to achieve a goal.
        \item A higher level group of projects targeted at a common goal.
        \item Example:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Project: completion of a required course in project management.
                \item Program: completion of all courses required for a business major. 
                \item Projects have a beginning and an end
                \item Projects start with a defined objective
            \end{itemize}
        \item Projects end:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item When the objective is met
                \item When the project results are not meeting organizational needs
            \end{itemize}

        \item Engineering concerns solving problems through projects that cost money and bring benefit.
        \item What are its major characteristics?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Has an established objective.
                \item Has a defined life span with a beginning and an end.
                \item Requires across-the-organizational participation.
                \item Involves doing something never been done before.
                \item Has specific time, cost, and performance requirements.
            \end{itemize}
